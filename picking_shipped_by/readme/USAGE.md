To assign a shipper to a single stock picking you need to go to a stock
picking form view and select a contact in the "Shipped By" field. Only
contacts marked as shippers can be selected. To mark the picking as
shipped, you need to activate the "Is Shipped" option.

To assign the same shipper to multiple stock pickings you need to:

1.  Go to the stock picking tree view and select multiple pickings
2.  Click on 'Action \> Configure Shipper'
3.  Select the shipper that needs to be assigned and click on "Configure
    Shipper" button. Only contacts marked as shippers can be selected.
